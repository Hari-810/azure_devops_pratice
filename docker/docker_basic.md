   - Example: `python:3.9`, `nginx:latest`.

4. **Docker Containers**

   - **Lightweight, isolated runtime environments** created from Docker Images.
   - Run applications without needing a full OS for each instance.
   - Example: `docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx`.

5. **Docker Registries**

   - Repositories where Docker images are stored and shared.
   - Public registry: **Docker Hub**.
   - Private registry: **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.

6. **Docker Network**

   - Enables communication between containers and external systems.
   - Types: **Bridge, Host, None, Overlay, Macvlan**.

7. **Docker Volume**
   - **Persistent storage** solution for Docker containers.
   - Used when containers need to retain data across restarts.

### **How Docker Works in Azure**

- **Docker images** are stored in **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.
- **Containers** run on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** or **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**.
- **CI/CD pipelines** use Docker for **automated deployments** via **Azure DevOps**.

# **Key Docker Components with Details**

Docker is built on a **client-server architecture** that enables seamless containerized application development, deployment, and management. Below are the **key components** of Docker and their detailed descriptions:

---

### **1. Docker Engine**

The **Docker Engine** is the **core component** responsible for **building, running, and managing** containers. It consists of:

- **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)** ‚Äì Runs in the background, processes Docker commands, and manages container lifecycle.
- **REST API** ‚Äì Enables communication between the Docker client and daemon.
- **CLI (Command-Line Interface)** ‚Äì Allows users to interact with Docker via commands like `docker run`, `docker build`, `docker ps`.

üìå **Example Command:**

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

_(Runs an Nginx container in detached mode, exposing port 80)_

---

### **2. Docker Image**

A **Docker Image** is a **lightweight, portable, and immutable** blueprint used to create containers.

- **Contains application code, runtime, libraries, dependencies, and configurations.**
- **Stored in Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry (ACR).**

üìå **Example:**

```bash
docker pull python:3.9
```

_(Downloads the Python 3.9 image from Docker Hub)_

---

### **3. Docker Container**

A **Docker Container** is a **running instance** of a Docker image.

- **Isolated, lightweight, and portable execution environment.**
- **Shares the host OS kernel but runs independently.**
- **Can be started, stopped, and removed as needed.**

üìå **Example:**

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```

_(Runs an Ubuntu container with interactive shell access)_

---

### **4. Docker Registry**

A **Docker Registry** stores and manages Docker images.

- **Public Registry**: **Docker Hub** (default registry).
- **Private Registry**: **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**, Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry.

üìå **Example:**

```bash
docker push myacr.azurecr.io/my-app:v1
```

_(Pushes an image to Azure Container Registry)_

---

### **5. Dockerfile**

A **Dockerfile** is a script containing **instructions** to build a Docker image.

- Defines how the container environment should be set up.
- Used with `docker build` to create custom images.

üìå **Example Dockerfile:**

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

_(Creates a Node.js environment for running an application)_

---

### **6. Docker Compose**

Docker Compose is a tool used to **define and run multi-container applications** using a `docker-compose.yml` file.

- Useful for defining **microservices, databases, and dependencies** in a single file.

üìå **Example `docker-compose.yml` File:**

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
```

_(Defines a web server and database service in a single configuration)_

üìå **Start Services Using:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

_(Runs services in the background)_

---

### **7. Docker Volume**

A **Docker Volume** is used for **persistent data storage** that survives container restarts.

- Essential for databases and applications that require persistent data.

üìå **Example:**

```bash
docker volume create mydata
docker run -v mydata:/var/lib/mysql -d mysql
```

_(Creates a volume and attaches it to a MySQL container)_

---

### **8. Docker Network**

Docker **networking** enables communication between containers and external systems.

- **Types of Networks:**
  - **Bridge** ‚Äì Default, allows isolated communication.
  - **Host** ‚Äì Uses the host machine‚Äôs networking.
  - **None** ‚Äì No networking.
  - **Overlay** ‚Äì Used in Swarm for multi-host communication.

üìå **Example:**

```bash
docker network create my-network
docker run --network=my-network -d nginx
```

_(Creates a custom network and runs an Nginx container inside it)_

---
